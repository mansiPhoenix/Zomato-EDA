# Zomato-EDA
Analyzing the Zomato dataset and extracting insights.

Analyzing the Zomato dataset gives a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Bengaluru, as well as the aggregate rating of each restaurant. Bengaluru, being one such city, has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening, the industry hasn’t been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. In spite of the increasing demand, however, it has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants, most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being the IT capital of India, most of the people here are dependent mainly on restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves.

## From all the Data available, we can bring out some neat insights or conclusions such as

- Most famous restaurant chains in Bengaluru
- Restaurants delivering Online or not
- Restaurants allowing table booking or not
- Table booking vs Rate
